## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Daniel.

I am a Remote Freelance Software Engineer and I like to travel. I'm currently based in Barcelona ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, but I really enjoy being a digital nomad and explore while working.
I learn by tinkering and doing. I'm an even better debugger than developer. I love picking up a new framework, API, or package and dissecting to see it's inner workings.
